The Connect Four Game Project is developed using C# Programming Language. It is composed of 9 Classes which are described as follows:
1. Player Class - Abstract class representing a player in the Connect Four game.
2. HumanPlayer Class - Derived class representing a human player in the game.
3. AIPlayer Class - Derived class representing an AI player in the game.
4. GameBoard Class - Representing the game board control and its operations.
5. Connect4TwoPlayerHuman Class - Implementing the game logic for a two-player human vs. human mode.
6. Cnnect4PlayerVsAI Class - Implementing the game logic for a human vs. AI mode.
7. Menu Class: Containing the game menu and related functionality.
8. IConnectFourGame Interface Class - Defining the Play method for Connect Four game modes.
9. Main Program Class - Contains the entry point for the application.

The code also applies the Error Management feature using try catch functions in the GetMove Method in GameBoard Class and in Game Menu Method in Menu Class.
OOP principles such as inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, and encapsulation were also applied in this project.
